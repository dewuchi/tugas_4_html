  <h1>Halaman 4 - MOTO GP</h1>

  <h2>Dovizioso: The Attendance King</h2>

  <p align="right">The Italian, along with teammate Jorge Lorenzo, has been competing on
    the World stage for 16 straight years - the third highest on the grid behind
    Valentino Rossi (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP) and Dani Pedrosa (Respol Honda Team).
    It's huge testament to the 32-year-old, who in the last two years has been -
   on paper - Marc Marquez' (Repsol Honda Team) most consistent challanger.</p>
